## Conclusion

The two major uptrends commenced at the beginning of a fiscal year [2011, 2017]
Caveat: As a side note, to formulate the Crossing Trading Systems, the annualized return and ROI formulas are based upon the 20, 50, 100- and 200-day moving averages. Hence any dates selected with a start date less than 200 trading days prior to today, i.e., in the range from  `` `r head(tail(index(xtsEMA),200),1)` `` to `` `r Sys.Date()` `` will generate an error. I am currently working on a solution.
