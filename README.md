Welcome to the SPL Golden Crossing Dashboard!

Mission: utilize Machine Learning & Fintech analytics to vette the ASX for compelling Small Cap Biotech risk adverse trading opportunities.

Objective: The purpose of this dashboard is twofold.

1. To provide a glimpse of Starpharma's performance circa 2002-01-02.
2. To examine the Golden Cross, Death Cross and No Cross Trading Strategies to discern their viability.

This site is developed using a reactive framework thereby allowing a dynamic interaction with any of the input variables. Therefore, whenever the date is updated the corresponding entries will be dynamically updated as well.

As a side note, to formulate the Crossing Trading Systems, the annualized return and ROI formulas are based upon the 20, 50, 100- and 200-day moving averages. Hence any dates selected with a start date less than 200 trading days prior to today, i.e., in the range from  `` `r head(tail(index(xtsEMA),200),1)` `` to `` `r Sys.Date()` `` will generate an error. I am currently working on a solution.

If you have any questions, or would like to provide feedback please: [email me](mailto:utexas80@gmail.com)

Thank you for your time and consideration. I hope that you enjoy the site.
