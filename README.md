Welcome to the SPL Golden Crossing Dashboard!

Hypothesis: Discern whether the trend is truly your friend.

Mission: utilize Machine Learning & Fintech analytics to vette the ASX for compelling Small Cap Biotech trading opportunities.

Objective: The purpose of this dashboard is twofold.

1. To provide a glimpse of Starpharma's performance circa 2002-01-02.
2. To examine the Golden Cross, Death Cross and No Cross Trading Strategies to discern their profitability.

Design: This site is developed using a reactive framework thereby allowing a dynamic interaction with any of the input variables. Therefore, whenever the date is updated the corresponding entries will be dynamically updated as well.

Layout: The dashboard is divided into two sections. 
  - The first section provides a summary of Starpharma's performance and historical returns.
    - The performance portion of the dashboard provides 
      - A table of prices along with the Simple and Exponential 20, 50, 100 and 200 moving averages. 
        - A filter is provided for each one of these components to help winnow down to a more granular level.
    - The second section analyzes Startpharma's historical return circa 2001.
      -Within this partitiion, Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Quarterly, and Yearly charts are displayed.        
        - Each of these can be further segmented into 1 month, 3 month, 6 month, Year-to-Date, 1 year and Cumulative time. frames.
      - In addition, a growth of $1 invested and Chaikan Money Flow chart are included. 
  - The second part delves into the different trends starting with an overall trading history and results and continuing with a section highlighting each
    trend.

Conclusion:    

Caveat: As a side note, to formulate the Crossing Trading Systems, the annualized return and ROI formulas are based upon the 20, 50, 100- and 200-day moving averages. Hence any dates selected with a start date less than 200 trading days prior to today, i.e., in the range from  `` `r head(tail(index(xtsEMA),200),1)` `` to `` `r Sys.Date()` `` will generate an error. I am currently working on a solution.
